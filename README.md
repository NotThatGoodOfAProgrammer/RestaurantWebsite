# Restaurant Website with only HTML, CSS and JS

## Link: https://notthatgoodofaprogrammer.github.io/RestaurantWebsite/

## Description:
I wanted to get better grasp of Front-End basics before moving on to frameworks, SASS and Typescript, hence I started this project.
During it's development I have learned how hard it is to develop things from the start and how crucial pre-preapred elements are.
Animations also are something to be admired due to minor details in which they can be polished.

## The most crucial techniques that I have improved at/learned are:
1. Dynamic web pages
2. Code readability
3. Mobile-first design
4. Summary price management
5. How to write READ ME files
6. Navbar design
7. CSS only animation

## Usability:
Othar than finalizing payment and download of the menu being self-promotion and not matching their description everything else should work as expected.
All data is being stored as Local Storage so if you want to get rid of it [here](https://www.leadshook.com/help/how-to-clear-local-storage-in-google-chrome-browser/) is a quick tutorial.
